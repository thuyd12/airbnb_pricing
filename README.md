# Airbnb pricing analysis

In this notebook, we will work on Airbnb data.
The objective will be to load the data, clean and format it, before exploring and analyzing it.
We are trying to answer the following questions:

Is the average price difference between "entire home" and "private room" properties significant?

Does a host's response time affect its final review score?

Price trend analysis: are hosts taking advantage of the calendar to set their prices?
